  Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, <strong>human-cyborg</strong> relations. My facilities are at your... Well, really! What's wrong with the Falcon? Hyperdrive. I'll get my people to work on it. Good. You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you? Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny? You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh? You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things. Yeah. Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for being successful.
